# Weekly Reports

Each team needs to send a maximum 1-page weekly status report in a bullet format to the assigned TA with the current developments and any issues that need to be raised. The 1-page status report needs to be sent to the assigned TA by every Thursday at 11:59pm and should include:


* the tasks that the team has been working since the last weekly report 
* the action items for the week ahead
* any questions or concerns that need to be raised to the TA
